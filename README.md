## Activate virtual Environment

If you are using VS Code, the virtual environment should be activated automatically when you open the folder in the container.

If you are using another editor or IDE, you may need to activate the virtual environment manually. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
